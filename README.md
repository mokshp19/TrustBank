## Description
This a mock website of a fake bank developed by us to showcase our programming skills. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
This website also uses the [Free Currency Exchange Rates API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api).

## Key Features

- Deposit & Withdraw From A Randomly Generated Bank Account
> Use the two buttons labeled "Deposit" and "Withdraw" when logged in to do this.

- Currency Exchange Feature
> Choose two currencies (e.g. CAD, USD) to exchange and type a money value to see the result. This feature uses this API: [https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/exchange-api)
